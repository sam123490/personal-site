        <p>I'm Samuel, a full-stack web developer. I love the struggle of overcoming
          challanges and finding several ways to achieve the same outcome. My goal is
          to make awesome websites and become financially independant while supporting
          my parents. I enjoy playing music and being outdoors.

      <h2 class="about-title">About Me</h2>
      <p>I got into coding after taking a web development course at my local comminuty
        college. I was intruiged and decided to persue this career further through
        online courses. One aspect that I love about coding, is taking a break from trying
        to solve a difficult problem and then coming up with a solution as I'm doing
        something else.
      </p>
      <p>Two of my hobbies are playing guitar and hiking. I've lived in California my
        whole life, but am fond of traveling. I recently went on a life-changing, several
        month hike through the appalachain mountains. Click below to see more.
